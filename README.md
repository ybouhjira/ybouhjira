I have been working since 2017 as a Javscript developer for [HSE](https://www.hse.de/) where I have worked within multiple multinational scrum teams to develop features for the main e-commerce website, intranet app, a large SPA application used by Callcenter agents that I helped develop from scratch and a few mobile apps. During this time I have written mainly frontend React code, used express, java and kotlin in the backend and worked on integrating multiple third party services.
